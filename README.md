# Classic_Snake_Game
Hello, So here we are back to play the classic snake game again.
Built in python using pygame.
Instructions would be:
We direct the snake's movement towards the food.
Everytime snake eats the food it's body grows.
Make sure the snake doesnt bite itself and also does not go out of the frame or hit the wall.
Good Luck, Build your own game and enjoy.
